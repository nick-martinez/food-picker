Continuing to use different project to build up my website development skillset, I used React (html, JS/ReactJS, and CSS) to created an application that allows for users to input up to 6 possible locations to eat at.

Above shows the initial page that allows for users to input up to 6 locations to throw onto the spinner that provides an output. Users are able to enter 2, 3, or 6 locations (multiples of 6) so that the code properly outputs the color wheel. They can freely delete and add options through clicking the "-" and "+" icons to the right of the input textbox. The application will automatically ensure the inputs are multiples of 6.

Above is the color wheel display before the spin button is clicked

Above is the color wheel after the spin button is clicked, thus picking the location for the user.
